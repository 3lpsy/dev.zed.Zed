    <p>
      Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. It combines the power of an IDE with the responsiveness of a lightweight editor for productivity you can feel under your fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zed leverages every CPU core and your GPU to start instantly, load files in a blink, and respond to your keystrokes on the next display refresh. It supports GitHub Copilot out of the box, and you can use GPT-4 to generate or refactor code with natural language prompts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zed maintains a full syntax tree for every buffer, enabling precise code highlighting, auto-indent, a searchable outline view, and structural selection. It also supports the Language Server Protocol for autocompletion, code navigation, diagnostics, and refactorings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zed integrates a full-featured terminal, Vim-style modal editing, and a variety of light and dark themes. Its collaborative features include shared workspaces, real-time navigation, and a virtual office for software teams with channels for discussion, planning, and project tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zed's performance is driven by the GPUI framework, multi-core support with Rust, and extensive fuzz testing for stability. Its CRDT-based buffers provide a foundation for multiple forms of collaboration.
